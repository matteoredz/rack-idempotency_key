A Rack Middleware implementing the idempotency design principle using the `Idempotency-Key` HTTP header. A cached response, generated by an idempotent request, can be recognized by checking for the presence of the `Idempotent-Replayed` response header.

## What is idempotency?

Idempotency is a design principle that allows a client to safely retry API requests that might have failed due to connection issues, without causing duplication or conflicts. In other words, no matter how many times you perform an idempotent operation, the end result will always be the same.

To be idempotent, only the state of the server is considered. The response returned by each request may differ: for example, the first call of a `DELETE` will likely return a `200`, while successive ones will likely return a `404`.

`POST`, `PATCH` and `CONNECT` are the non-idempotent methods, and this gem exists to make them so.

## Under the hood

- A valid idempotent request is cached on the server, using the `store` of choice
- A cached response expires out of the system after `24 hours`
- A response with a `400` (BadRequest) HTTP status code isn't cached

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "rack-idempotency_key"
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install rack-idempotency_key

## General usage

You may use this Rack Middleware in any application that conforms to the [Rack Specification](https://github.com/rack/rack/blob/main/SPEC.rdoc). Please refer to the specific application's guidelines.

## Usage with Rails

```ruby
# config/application.rb

module MyApp
  class Application < Rails::Application
    # ...

    config.middleware.use(
      Rack::IdempotencyKey,
      store: Rack::IdempotencyKey::MemoryStore.new,
      routes: [
        { path: "/posts", method: "POST" },
        { path: "/posts/*", method: "PATCH" },
        { path: "/posts/*/comments", method: "POST" }
      ]
    )
  end
end
```

## Available Stores

The Store is responsible for getting and setting the response from a cache of a given idempotent request.

### MemoryStore

This one is the default store. It caches the response in memory.

```ruby
Rack::IdempotencyKey::MemoryStore.new

# Explicitly set the key's expiration, in seconds. The default is 86_400 (24 hours)
Rack::IdempotencyKey::MemoryStore.new(expires_in: 43_200)
```

### RedisStore

This one is the suggested store to use in production. It relies on the [redis gem](https://github.com/redis/redis-rb).

```ruby
Rack::IdempotencyKey::RedisStore.new(Redis.current)

# Explicitly set the key's expiration, in seconds. The default is 86_400 (24 hours)
Rack::IdempotencyKey::RedisStore.new(Redis.current, expires_in: 43_200)
```

Every key written to Redis will get prefixed with `idempotency_key` to avoid conflicts on shared instances.

### Custom Store

Any object that conforms to the following interface can be used as a custom Store:

```ruby
# @param [String] key
#
# @return [Array]
def get(key)

# @param [String] key
# @param [Array]  value
#
# @return [Array]
def set(key, value)
```

The Array returned must conform to the [Rack Specification](https://github.com/rack/rack/blob/main/SPEC.rdoc), as follows:

```ruby
[
  200, # Response code
  {},  # Response headers
  []   # Response body
]
```

## Idempotent Routes

To declare the routes where you want to enable idempotency, you only need to pass a `route` keyword parameter when the Middleware gets mounted.

Each route entry must be compliant with what follows:

```ruby
routes: [
  { path: "/posts", method: "POST" },
  { path: "/posts/*", method: "PATCH" },
  { path: "/posts/*/comments", method: "POST" }
]
```

The `*` char is a placeholder representing a named parameter that will get converted to an any-chars regex.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies.
Then, run `rake test` to run the tests.
You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`.
To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`,
which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags,
and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
